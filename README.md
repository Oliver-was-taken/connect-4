# Connect Four Alpha-Beta Bot ðŸ¤–
## General Information
For this project I implemented a Connect 4, which uses an Alpha-Beta algorithm to determinate the best possible next move.
To support this algorithm I implemented some small features like move-ordering or a function to determinate if the bot could be winning or not.
Other Methods which are required by the Alpha-Beta algorithm like a rate-function or a function to calculate all possible moves were also implemented.

## Testing
There are a few general tests which mainly test the bot by letting him play against himself with different depths.
Also, there are tests to test the function to determinate wins and loses.

## Self-rating
5.5/6 - I would say the bot is pretty solid. It could be improved with things like a BitBoard or cache, which is in my opinion over the scope for this project.
